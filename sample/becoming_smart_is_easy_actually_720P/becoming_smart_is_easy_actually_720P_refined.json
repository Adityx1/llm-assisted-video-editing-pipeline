One, unless you practice the skill, your brain will think it's useless and forget it. Two, you only have to know 20% of the knowledge to master 80% of the skill."

By imagining the whole process from start to finish, you just convinced your brain that you used all that information, and now you'll remember it."

You learn a piece of information, and your teacher creates an imaginary situation where that information is useful. That is, a test."

There's no fluff, no hand holding, no distractions, just pure information, and a bunch of practice questions."
